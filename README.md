## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Taiwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework


### What I learned

During this CSS challenge, I used Tailwind CSS for the first time, and I found it easier than installing the full package via npm. I also learned that even an empty Tailwind configuration file is necessary for the Tailwind classes to function correctly.
